## [v7.0.0-1.20] - 2023-06-10
- Ported to Minecraft 1.20
### Changed
- All villagers can now accept a contract, this now depends on the level (novice, journeyman, master, ...) of the villager
- Each level will increase the chance for accepting a contract by 20%, so a master level villager is guaranteed to accept a contract if no lower level worked
